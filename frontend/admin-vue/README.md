# Vue Admin

This directory contains a minimal Vue3 + Element Plus admin console example.

Pages:
- `FeederAudit.vue` – list feeders pending approval with approve/reject actions.
- `OrderList.vue` – view orders and update status.

This is only a starter implementation; expand it to cover full management features.
