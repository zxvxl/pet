# Pet Feeding Service

This repository contains the backend and frontend code for the pet feeding mini-program project.

## Structure

- `backend/` - NestJS backend service
- `frontend/miniapp/` - Uni-app based WeChat mini-program
- `ui-tests/` - Example UI automation tests

The project currently does **not** include a web-based admin console. Consider generating or implementing one separately if needed.

See `docs/ui-testing.md` for running the UI tests with miniprogram-automator.
